# Thoughts Directory

This directory contains documentation about the evolution of our Flux2 multi-tenancy setup, organized by projects and root-level planning.

## Directory Structure

### Root Planning (/root)
Contains high-level, project-wide documentation:
- `decisions.md` - Strategic architectural and design decisions affecting the entire system
- `experiments.md` - System-wide experiments and tests
- `history.md` - Overall project timeline and major milestones

### Projects (/projects)
Contains project-specific documentation directories. Each project follows the structure:
```
projects/
├── project-name/
│   ├── README.md         - Project overview and status
│   ├── decisions.md      - Project-specific decisions
│   ├── experiments.md    - Project-specific experiments
│   ├── history.md        - Project timeline
│   ├── plans.md          - Detailed implementation planning
│   └── testing.md        - Comprehensive test strategy
```

## Usage Guidelines

1. Root-level Documentation:
   - Use `/root` for decisions that affect multiple projects
   - Document system-wide architectural changes
   - Track major milestones and cross-project dependencies

2. Project-specific Documentation:
   - Create a new directory under `/projects` for each distinct initiative
   - Follow the standard project structure
   - Keep project-specific concerns isolated

3. Planning Structure:
   - Organize tasks by priority with detailed implementation strategy
   - Document comprehensive requirements for each task:
     * Implementation details and subtasks
     * Documentation requirements
     * Testing requirements
     * Verification criteria
   - Define measurable success criteria with:
     * Verification methods
     * Testing approaches
     * Documentation requirements
   - Include detailed risk assessment and mitigation strategies

4. Documentation Standards:
   - Use clear, descriptive titles
   - Document context and rationale
   - Document both successes and failures
   - Link to relevant issues/PRs
   - Use consistent markdown formatting
   - Include for each component:
     * API documentation
     * Architecture diagrams
     * Configuration guides
     * Deployment procedures
     * Troubleshooting guides

5. Testing Framework:
   - Define comprehensive test strategy:
     * Unit testing requirements
     * Integration testing approach
     * End-to-end testing plans
   - Document test cases and scenarios
   - Specify verification methods
   - Define quality gates and metrics
   - Maintain test environment requirements

6. Project Creation:
   - Copy template structure from /projects/template
   - Initialize all required documentation files
   - Define clear priorities and dependencies
   - Establish measurable success criteria

7. Regular Maintenance:
   - Review and update priority lists
   - Track completed items
   - Reassess dependencies
   - Update risk assessments
   - Clean up outdated information

8. Dependencies:
   - Document both technical and operational dependencies
   - Track cross-project dependencies in root documentation
   - Regularly validate dependency status
   - Plan for dependency failures
