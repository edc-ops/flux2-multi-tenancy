# Thoughts Directory

This directory contains documentation about the evolution of our Flux2 multi-tenancy setup, organized by projects and root-level planning. It follows the thoughts-framework structure for AI-driven project planning and documentation.

## Directory Structure

### Root Planning (/root)
Contains high-level, project-wide documentation using the thoughts-framework templates:
- `decisions.md` - Strategic architectural and design decisions affecting the entire system
- `experiments.md` - System-wide experiments and tests
- `history.md` - Overall project timeline and major milestones

### Projects (/projects)
Contains project-specific documentation directories. Each project follows the thoughts-framework structure:
```
projects/
├── project-name/
│   ├── README.md         - Project overview and status
│   ├── tasks/           
│   │   ├── active/      - Currently in-progress tasks
│   │   ├── backlog/     - Planned but not started tasks
│   │   └── completed/   - Finished tasks
│   ├── decisions/       - Project-specific decisions
│   ├── experiments/     - Project-specific experiments
│   ├── history.md       - Project timeline
│   └── plans.md         - Detailed implementation planning
```

## Usage Guidelines

1. Document Creation:
   - Use templates from thoughts-framework/templates/ for all new documents
   - Ensure all documents include the required metadata schema
   - Place documents in the appropriate directory based on type and status

2. Metadata Requirements:
   - All documents must include the standard metadata header
   - Follow the JSON Schema defined in thoughts-framework
   - Include comprehensive AI context for automated processing
   - Keep metadata fields up to date

3. Project Management:
   - Create new projects using the framework's project structure
   - Move tasks between active/backlog/completed as status changes
   - Keep README.md updated with current project status
   - Document all significant decisions and experiments

4. Documentation Standards:
   - Use clear, descriptive titles
   - Include comprehensive metadata
   - Document context and rationale
   - Link related documents using relative paths
   - Follow markdown best practices

5. Task Management:
   - Place new tasks in backlog/
   - Move to active/ when work begins
   - Move to completed/ when finished
   - Include all required metadata fields
   - Update status and progress regularly

6. Decision Records:
   - Use the decision template for all decisions
   - Include alternatives considered
   - Document impact and consequences
   - Link related tasks and experiments

7. Experiments:
   - Use the experiment template
   - Document hypothesis and methodology
   - Include success criteria
   - Record results and conclusions

8. Validation:
   - Run metadata validation regularly:
     ```bash
     npx @cline/thoughts-framework validate /path/to/thoughts
     ```
   - Fix any validation errors promptly
   - Keep metadata schema up to date

## AI Agent Usage

The thoughts framework is designed to work with AI agents (like myself) for enhanced project management:

1. Task Planning:
   - AI can analyze task metadata for complexity and dependencies
   - Suggest task prioritization and sequencing
   - Identify potential risks and blockers

2. Decision Support:
   - AI can analyze decision records for patterns
   - Suggest alternatives based on past decisions
   - Evaluate impact and consequences

3. Experiment Analysis:
   - AI can analyze experiment results
   - Suggest improvements to methodology
   - Compare results across related experiments

4. Progress Tracking:
   - AI can monitor task status and progress
   - Identify blocked or at-risk tasks
   - Suggest process improvements

## Framework Integration

This thoughts directory is integrated with the thoughts-framework package, which provides:

- Standard templates for tasks, decisions, and experiments
- Metadata validation tools
- AI-readable schema definitions
- Documentation standards

For framework updates and tools, refer to the thoughts-framework documentation.
