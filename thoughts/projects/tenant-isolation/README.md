# Tenant Isolation Project

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing comprehensive tenant isolation in our Kubernetes multi-tenancy setup. The goal is to ensure complete isolation between tenants while maintaining operational efficiency and security.

## Objectives
1. Implement robust RBAC controls for tenant isolation
2. Establish network policies for inter-tenant communication control
3. Configure resource quotas and limits for fair resource sharing
4. Set up comprehensive security monitoring and alerting

## Key Components

### 1. Access Control
- Enhanced RBAC implementation
- Least-privilege access patterns
- Comprehensive audit logging

### 2. Network Isolation
- Inter-tenant network policies
- Ingress/egress controls
- Network monitoring and alerting

### 3. Resource Management
- Tenant-specific resource quotas
- Fair resource sharing mechanisms
- Resource usage monitoring

### 4. Security Controls
- Continuous security monitoring
- Automated compliance checking
- Incident response automation

## Project Status

### Current Phase
- Initial planning and architecture design
- Task breakdown and prioritization
- Risk assessment and mitigation planning

### Next Steps
1. Implement RBAC enhancements
2. Deploy network policies
3. Configure resource management
4. Set up security monitoring

## Documentation Index

### Tasks

- Organized by status (active/backlog/completed)
- Each task includes detailed implementation plans

### Decisions
- Located in `/decisions` directory
- Documents architectural and technical decisions
- Includes context and consequences

### Experiments

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
1. Performance Impact
   - Policy enforcement overhead
   - Resource management complexity
   - Monitoring system load

2. Integration Complexity
   - Multiple system dependencies
   - Cross-component interactions
   - Version compatibility

### Operational Risks
1. User Adoption
   - Learning curve for new controls
   - Process changes required
   - Documentation needs

2. Maintenance Overhead
   - Increased system complexity
   - Operational procedures
   - Monitoring requirements

## Success Metrics
1. Security
   - Complete tenant isolation verified
   - No cross-tenant access possible
   - All security events detected

2. Performance
   - Minimal overhead from controls
   - Resource fairness achieved
   - No service degradation

3. Usability
   - Clear operational procedures
   - Automated workflows where possible
   - Comprehensive monitoring
