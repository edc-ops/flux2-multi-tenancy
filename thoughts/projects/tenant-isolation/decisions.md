#### Initial Multi-Tenancy Structure

**Context:**
- Setting up a multi-tenant Kubernetes environment using Flux2
- Need to manage multiple clusters (staging, production)

   - Pros:
     - Simpler to manage
     - Clear visibility of all configurations
     - Easier to enforce standards

2. Multiple Repositories per Team
   - Pros:
     - More team autonomy
     - Better isolation
   - Cons:
     - Harder to maintain consistency
     - More complex access management

**Decision:**
- Chose single repository approach with structured directories
- Implemented clear separation between infrastructure and tenant configurations
- Used Kustomize for environment-specific overlays

**Consequences:**
- Better standardization across teams
- Centralized change management
- Need to implement robust RBAC for team access
- Regular reviews needed to ensure structure scales with organization
