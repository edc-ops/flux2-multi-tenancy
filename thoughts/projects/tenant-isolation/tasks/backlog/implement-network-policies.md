# Implement Network Policies

## Overview
Implement comprehensive network policies to ensure proper isolation between tenants while maintaining necessary communication paths and monitoring capabilities.

## Objectives
1. Implement network isolation between tenants
2. Configure baseline security policies
3. Set up network monitoring and alerting
4. Establish policy management processes

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Network Isolation
   - Tenant-specific network boundaries
   - Controlled inter-tenant communication
   - External access controls
   - DNS policy management

2. Policy Management
   - Baseline policy templates
   - Tenant-specific customizations
   - Change management process
   - Policy validation

3. Monitoring
   - Traffic monitoring
   - Policy violation detection
   - Performance impact tracking
   - Alert management

### Technical Requirements
1. Network Policies
   - Namespace isolation rules
   - Ingress/egress controls
   - Protocol restrictions
   - Port management

2. Monitoring Infrastructure
   - Traffic analysis tools
   - Log aggregation
   - Alert configuration
   - Dashboard setup

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Design & Planning
1. Analyze Requirements
   - Document communication patterns
   - Map security requirements
   - Identify critical paths
   - Define isolation boundaries

2. Design Policy Structure
   - Create policy templates
   - Define validation rules
   - Plan monitoring approach
   - Document exceptions

### Phase 2: Implementation
1. Deploy Base Policies
   - Implement namespace isolation
   - Configure ingress rules
   - Set up egress controls
   - Apply DNS policies

2. Configure Monitoring
   - Deploy monitoring tools
   - Set up log collection
   - Configure dashboards
   - Implement alerts

### Phase 3: Validation
1. Test Network Controls
   - Verify isolation
   - Test allowed paths
   - Validate DNS resolution
   - Check performance impact

2. Document and Train
   - Create admin guides
   - Write user documentation
   - Conduct training
   - Establish support process

## Success Criteria

### Security
1. Network Isolation
   - Complete tenant isolation
   - Controlled communication paths
   - Proper DNS resolution
   - Secure external access

2. Monitoring Coverage
   - All traffic monitored
   - Violations detected
   - Alerts functioning
   - Logs collected

### Performance
1. Network Operations
   - Minimal latency impact
   - Efficient policy processing
   - Reliable DNS resolution
   - Stable connections

2. Monitoring System
   - Low overhead
   - Quick alert generation
