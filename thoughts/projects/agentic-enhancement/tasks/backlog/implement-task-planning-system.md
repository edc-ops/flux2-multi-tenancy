# Implement AI Task Planning System

## Overview
Design and implement the core AI task planning system that will enable autonomous task management, dependency resolution, and resource optimization. This system will serve as the foundation for AI-driven project management capabilities.

## Objectives
- Create a robust task representation format
- Implement task planning algorithms
- Develop resource allocation system
- Build priority calculation engine
- Create task estimation framework

## Requirements
- Task representation must include dependencies, priorities, and resource requirements
- Planning algorithms must handle complex dependency chains
- System must support dynamic priority adjustments
- Resource allocation must optimize for efficiency
- Time estimation must learn from historical data
- System must integrate with existing project structure

## Dependencies
- AI-readable documentation structure
- Metadata schema implementation
- Project template structure

## Implementation Plan

### Steps
1. Design task representation format
   - Define JSON schema for tasks
   - Implement validation system
   - Create serialization/deserialization utilities

2. Develop core planning algorithms
   - Implement dependency resolution
   - Create priority calculation system
   - Build resource allocation optimizer
   - Develop scheduling algorithm

3. Create estimation system
   - Design historical data collection
   - Implement estimation algorithms
   - Create feedback loop for accuracy improvement

4. Build integration layer
   - Implement file system integration
   - Create git operation handlers
   - Develop documentation updaters

5. Create monitoring and metrics
   - Define key performance indicators
   - Implement metrics collection
   - Create reporting system

### Resources Required
