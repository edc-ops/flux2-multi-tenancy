# Architectural Decisions

## ADR 1: AI-Readable Documentation Structure

### Status: Proposed
### Date: 2024-01-19

### Context
The current thoughts framework needs enhancement to support AI-driven task planning and automation. The documentation structure must be machine-readable while maintaining human readability.

### Decision
Implement a YAML-based metadata schema at the top of each markdown document:

```yaml
---
type: decision|experiment|plan|history
status: draft|in-progress|completed|archived
priority: low|medium|high
dependencies: []
created: 2024-01-19T00:00:00Z
updated: 2024-01-19T00:00:00Z
version: 1.0.0
tags: []
ai_context:
  task_type: documentation
  automation_level: full
  requires_human_review: false
---
```

### Consequences
Positive:
- Structured metadata enables automated processing
- Clear schema for AI interpretation
- Maintains markdown readability
- Version control friendly

Negative:
- Additional overhead in document creation
- Need for metadata validation
- Migration effort for existing documents

## ADR 2: Task Management Structure

### Status: Proposed
### Date: 2024-01-19

### Context
AI-driven task planning requires a structured approach to task representation and management.

### Decision
Implement a task management system using a directory-based approach:

```
tasks/
├── backlog/          # Pending tasks
│   └── task-id.md   # Individual task files
├── active/          # In-progress tasks
└── completed/       # Finished tasks
```

Each task file follows a structured format:
```yaml
---
id: TASK-123
title: Implement Feature X
status: backlog|active|completed
priority: low|medium|high
dependencies: []
estimated_hours: 8
assigned_to: ai|human
created: 2024-01-19T00:00:00Z
updated: 2024-01-19T00:00:00Z
---

# Task Description
[Markdown content]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## Implementation Notes
[AI-generated implementation details]

## Progress Updates
[Automated progress tracking]
```

### Consequences
Positive:
- Clear task organization
- Easy status tracking
- Automated task management
- Git-friendly structure

Negative:
- More complex than simple issue tracking
- Requires tooling for efficient management
- Storage overhead for task history

## ADR 3: Automation Integration

### Status: Proposed
### Date: 2024-01-19

### Context
The framework needs to support automated task execution and documentation updates.

### Decision
Implement an automation system with the following components:

1. Git Integration
   - Automated commits for documentation updates
   - Branch management for task implementation
   - PR creation and management

2. Task Automation
   - Task status updates
   - Progress tracking
   - Dependency management
   - Resource allocation

3. Documentation Generation
   - Automated updates to project documentation
   - Metrics collection and reporting
   - Status dashboard generation

### Consequences
Positive:
- Reduced manual overhead
- Consistent documentation
- Automated tracking
- Improved visibility

Negative:
- Complex implementation
- Potential for automation errors
- Need for fallback procedures
- Initial setup overhead

## ADR 4: AI Decision Boundaries

### Status: Proposed
### Date: 2024-01-19

### Context
Clear boundaries must be established for AI decision-making capabilities.

### Decision
Implement a tiered decision-making system:

1. Autonomous Decisions
   - Documentation updates
   - Task prioritization
   - Resource estimation
   - Progress tracking

2. Human Review Required
   - Major architectural changes
   - Security-related changes
   - Critical path modifications
   - Resource allocation above thresholds

3. Hybrid Decisions
   - Technical implementation details
   - Risk assessments
   - Quality evaluations
   - Performance optimizations

### Consequences
Positive:
- Clear decision boundaries
- Reduced risk of errors
- Appropriate human oversight
- Scalable automation

Negative:
- Additional complexity
- Potential workflow delays
- Need for decision tracking
- Training overhead
