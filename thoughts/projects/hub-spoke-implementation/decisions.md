# Hub-Spoke Implementation Decisions

## Architectural Decisions

### ADR-001: Hub Cluster Architecture
**Status:** Proposed  
**Context:** Need to design the hub cluster architecture that can efficiently manage multiple spoke clusters  
**Decision:** 
- Use dedicated control plane nodes for hub cluster
- Implement high availability configuration
- Use etcd for state management
- Deploy dedicated monitoring stack

**Consequences:**
- Improved reliability and availability
- Higher resource requirements
- Better isolation of management functions
- Increased operational complexity

### ADR-002: Cluster Communication Protocol
**Status:** Proposed  
**Context:** Need to establish secure and efficient communication between hub and spoke clusters  
**Decision:**
- Use mutual TLS for authentication
- Implement gRPC for efficient communication
- Deploy service mesh for traffic management
- Use cluster-to-cluster VPN for secure connectivity

**Consequences:**
- Enhanced security through encryption
- Improved performance with gRPC
- Better traffic control and observability
- Additional complexity in network management

### ADR-003: Policy Management Strategy
**Status:** Proposed  
**Context:** Need to implement centralized policy management that maintains multi-tenancy  
**Decision:**
- Use Kyverno for policy enforcement
- Implement hierarchical policy structure
- Create policy templates for common scenarios
- Use GitOps workflow for policy management

**Consequences:**
- Consistent policy enforcement
- Simplified policy management
- Clear audit trail
- Learning curve for policy development

### ADR-004: Multi-tenancy Preservation
**Status:** Proposed  
**Context:** Need to maintain existing multi-tenancy features while implementing hub-spoke model  
**Decision:**
- Keep tenant isolation at spoke level
- Implement tenant-aware policies in hub
- Use namespace-based segregation
- Maintain separate RBAC for hub and spoke operations

**Consequences:**
- Preserved tenant isolation
- Clear separation of concerns
- Simplified tenant management
- Additional complexity in policy design

### ADR-005: Monitoring and Observability
**Status:** Proposed  
**Context:** Need comprehensive monitoring across hub and spoke clusters  
**Decision:**
- Deploy Prometheus for metrics collection
- Use Grafana for visualization
- Implement OpenTelemetry for tracing
- Centralize log aggregation in hub

**Consequences:**
- Improved visibility across clusters
- Better troubleshooting capabilities
- Increased resource usage
- More complex monitoring setup

### ADR-006: Backup and Recovery
**Status:** Proposed  
**Context:** Need reliable backup and recovery mechanisms for the entire system  
**Decision:**
- Implement Velero for cluster backup
- Use GitOps for configuration backup
- Create automated backup schedules
- Implement cross-cluster disaster recovery

**Consequences:**
- Reliable backup system
- Quick recovery capabilities
- Additional storage requirements
- Regular backup testing needed

### ADR-007: Security Implementation
**Status:** Proposed  
**Context:** Need to ensure security across the hub-spoke architecture  
**Decision:**
- Implement zero-trust security model
- Use service mesh for security features
- Deploy security policies at hub level
- Implement comprehensive audit logging

**Consequences:**
- Enhanced security posture
- Better control over access
- Additional operational overhead
- Increased complexity in troubleshooting

## Implementation Decisions

### IDR-001: GitOps Workflow
**Status:** Proposed  
**Context:** Need to define GitOps workflow for hub-spoke management  
**Decision:**
- Use single repository for hub configuration
- Maintain separate repositories for spokes
- Implement automated synchronization
- Use branch protection rules

**Consequences:**
- Clear change management
- Improved auditability
- Simplified rollback process
- Need for careful repository management

### IDR-002: Deployment Strategy
**Status:** Proposed  
**Context:** Need to define how changes are deployed across clusters  
**Decision:**
- Use progressive deployment pattern
- Implement automatic rollback triggers
- Create deployment validation gates
- Use canary deployments for critical changes

**Consequences:**
- Reduced risk in deployments
- Better control over changes
- Longer deployment times
- Need for comprehensive testing

## Future Considerations

### FCR-001: Scalability
- Evaluate need for multiple hub clusters
- Consider geographic distribution
- Plan for additional spoke clusters
- Assess resource scaling requirements

### FCR-002: Integration
- Consider external system integration
- Plan for additional tooling
- Evaluate cloud provider integration
- Assess compliance requirements
