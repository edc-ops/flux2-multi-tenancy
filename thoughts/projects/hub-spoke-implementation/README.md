# Hub-Spoke Implementation Project

## Overview
This project aims to transform the current multi-tenancy FluxCD setup into a hub-spoke architecture while maintaining the existing multi-tenancy features. The hub cluster will manage multiple spoke clusters (currently production and staging), enabling centralized management and policy enforcement.

## Objectives
1. Implement a hub cluster configuration that manages multiple spoke clusters
2. Convert existing production and staging clusters to spoke clusters
3. Maintain current multi-tenancy features and security policies
4. Enable centralized policy management from the hub cluster

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Hub Cluster Setup
1. Create hub cluster infrastructure
   - Set up flux-system components for hub cluster
   - Configure hub-specific Kyverno policies
   - Implement hub-level RBAC configuration

2. Implement Spoke Cluster Management
   - Create GitRepository resources for spoke clusters
   - Set up Kustomizations for spoke cluster management
   - Implement cluster registration mechanism

### Phase 2: Spoke Cluster Conversion
1. Modify Existing Clusters
   - Update production cluster configuration for spoke model
   - Update staging cluster configuration for spoke model
   - Implement spoke-specific security policies

2. Implement Hub-Spoke Communication
   - Set up secure communication channels
   - Configure cross-cluster service discovery
   - Implement cluster health monitoring

### Phase 3: Policy and Security Implementation
1. Centralized Policy Management
   - Implement cluster-wide policy distribution
   - Set up policy enforcement mechanisms
   - Configure policy compliance monitoring

2. Security Hardening
   - Implement cross-cluster authentication
   - Set up secure secret management
   - Configure network policies for hub-spoke communication

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
1. Testing Strategy
   - Unit tests for new components
   - Integration tests for hub-spoke communication
   - End-to-end testing of policy propagation

2. Validation Steps
   - Verify multi-tenancy isolation
   - Test policy enforcement
   - Validate cluster health monitoring

## Success Criteria
1. Hub cluster successfully manages both production and staging clusters
2. Multi-tenancy features remain fully functional
3. Centralized policies are properly enforced across all clusters
4. Secure communication between hub and spoke clusters
5. Comprehensive monitoring and alerting system in place

## Risks and Mitigations
1. Risk: Service disruption during conversion
   - Mitigation: Implement changes gradually with proper testing
   - Mitigation: Maintain rollback procedures

2. Risk: Security vulnerabilities in hub-spoke communication
   - Mitigation: Implement strong authentication and encryption
   - Mitigation: Regular security audits

3. Risk: Performance impact on hub cluster
   - Mitigation: Implement proper resource allocation
   - Mitigation: Monitor hub cluster performance metrics

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 1-2 weeks
- Phase 2: 2-3 weeks
- Phase 3: 2-3 weeks
- Phase 4: 1-2 weeks

Total estimated time: 6-10 weeks
