# Implement Policy Management System

## Metadata
- Status: Not Started
- Priority: High
- Assignee: TBD
- Epic: Hub-Spoke Implementation
- Start Date: TBD
- Due Date: TBD
- Estimated Hours: 24

## Description
Implement a centralized policy management system that will enforce security, compliance, and operational policies across all spoke clusters while maintaining multi-tenancy requirements.

## Objectives
1. Design policy management architecture
2. Implement policy distribution mechanism
3. Configure policy enforcement
4. Set up compliance monitoring
5. Implement policy versioning and rollback

## Technical Requirements
1. Policy Architecture
   - Design policy hierarchy
   - Define policy templates
   - Create policy validation rules
   - Implement policy versioning

2. Distribution System
   - Configure policy synchronization
   - Implement change management
   - Set up rollback mechanisms
   - Configure conflict resolution

3. Enforcement Mechanism
   - Implement Kyverno policies
   - Configure admission controllers
   - Set up policy validation
   - Implement exception handling

4. Compliance Monitoring
   - Configure audit logging
   - Set up compliance reporting
   - Implement alerting
   - Create dashboards

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Policy management system operational
2. Policies successfully distributed to spokes
3. Policy enforcement verified
4. Compliance monitoring active
5. Documentation complete
6. Rollback procedures tested

## Dependencies
- Hub cluster implementation
- Spoke cluster configuration
- Security infrastructure
- Monitoring system

## Risks
1. Policy conflicts
2. Performance impact
3. Compliance gaps
4. Integration issues

## Mitigation Strategy
1. Comprehensive policy testing
2. Performance monitoring
3. Regular compliance audits
4. Phased rollout

## Testing Requirements
1. Policy Testing
   - Template validation
   - Distribution testing
   - Enforcement verification
   - Exception handling

2. Integration Testing
   - Cross-cluster policy sync
   - Multi-tenancy validation
   - Conflict resolution
   - Rollback procedures

3. Performance Testing
   - Policy evaluation speed
   - Distribution latency
   - System impact
   - Scalability testing

## Documentation Requirements
1. Policy architecture documentation
2. Implementation guides
3. Operational procedures
4. Troubleshooting guides
5. Compliance reporting

## Notes
- Ensure policy consistency across clusters
- Maintain audit trail of changes
- Consider compliance requirements
- Document exception processes

## Related Tasks
- Hub cluster implementation
- Spoke cluster configuration
- Security implementation
- Monitoring setup

## Updates
- Initial task creation: [Date TBD]
