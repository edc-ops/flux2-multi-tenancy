# Implement Hub Cluster

## Metadata
- Status: Not Started
- Priority: High
- Assignee: TBD
- Epic: Hub-Spoke Implementation
- Start Date: TBD
- Due Date: TBD
- Estimated Hours: 40

## Description
Set up the hub cluster infrastructure and core components required for managing spoke clusters. This task involves creating the foundational infrastructure for the hub cluster that will manage multiple spoke clusters while maintaining multi-tenancy features.

## Objectives
1. Create hub cluster base infrastructure
2. Configure Flux system components
3. Set up monitoring and observability stack
4. Implement security policies and RBAC
5. Configure backup and disaster recovery

## Technical Requirements
1. Infrastructure Setup
   - Deploy Kubernetes control plane with HA configuration
   - Configure etcd cluster
   - Set up networking components
   - Implement storage solution

2. Flux Configuration
   - Install Flux v2 components
   - Configure GitOps repositories
   - Set up multi-tenancy controls
   - Implement policy management

3. Monitoring Stack
   - Deploy Prometheus and Grafana
   - Configure alerting rules
   - Set up logging infrastructure
   - Implement tracing solution

4. Security Implementation
   - Configure cluster RBAC
   - Set up network policies
   - Implement security policies
   - Configure audit logging

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Hub cluster is operational with all core components running
2. Flux is properly configured and can manage GitOps workflows
3. Monitoring stack is operational with basic dashboards
4. Security policies are in place and enforced
5. Backup solution is configured and tested
6. Documentation is complete and up-to-date

## Dependencies
- Kubernetes cluster provisioning
- Network infrastructure
- Storage infrastructure
- Required tools and utilities

## Risks
1. Resource constraints during setup
2. Network connectivity issues
3. Security policy conflicts
4. Integration challenges with existing systems

## Mitigation Strategy
1. Pre-validate resource requirements
2. Test network connectivity before implementation
3. Review and test security policies in isolation
4. Create integration test environment

## Testing Requirements
1. Infrastructure Tests
   - Control plane functionality
   - Network connectivity
   - Storage operations
   - High availability failover

2. Flux Tests
   - GitOps workflow validation
   - Multi-tenancy isolation
   - Policy enforcement
   - Configuration synchronization

3. Security Tests
   - RBAC validation
   - Network policy testing
   - Security policy verification
   - Audit logging validation

## Documentation Requirements
1. Architecture documentation
2. Installation procedures
3. Configuration guides
4. Operational procedures
5. Troubleshooting guides

## Notes
- Regular backups of etcd must be configured
- Monitoring alerts should be properly routed
- Security policies must align with organizational standards
- Documentation should be maintained in the repository

## Related Tasks
- Set up spoke cluster configuration
- Implement policy management
- Configure monitoring and alerting
- Implement security controls

## Updates
- Initial task creation: [Date TBD]
