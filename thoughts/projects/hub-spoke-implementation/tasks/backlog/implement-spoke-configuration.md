# Implement Spoke Cluster Configuration

## Metadata
- Status: Not Started
- Priority: High
- Assignee: TBD
- Epic: Hub-Spoke Implementation
- Start Date: TBD
- Due Date: TBD
- Estimated Hours: 32

## Description
Configure and implement the spoke cluster components that will be managed by the hub cluster. This includes converting existing production and staging clusters to the spoke model while maintaining their current multi-tenancy features.

## Objectives
1. Design spoke cluster architecture
2. Convert existing clusters to spoke model
3. Implement secure hub-spoke communication
4. Configure policy enforcement
5. Set up monitoring and reporting

## Technical Requirements
1. Spoke Architecture
   - Define spoke cluster components
   - Design communication channels
   - Plan resource allocation
   - Configure networking topology

2. Cluster Conversion
   - Update existing cluster configurations
   - Implement spoke-specific components
   - Configure GitOps workflows
   - Maintain multi-tenancy features

3. Security Implementation
   - Configure mutual TLS
   - Set up RBAC policies
   - Implement network policies
   - Configure audit logging

4. Monitoring Integration
   - Deploy monitoring agents
   - Configure metrics collection
   - Set up log forwarding
   - Implement health checks

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Existing clusters successfully converted to spoke model
2. Secure communication established with hub cluster
3. Policy enforcement working correctly
4. Multi-tenancy features preserved
5. Monitoring and logging operational
6. Documentation complete and accurate

## Dependencies
- Hub cluster implementation
- Network infrastructure
- Security policies
- Monitoring stack

## Risks
1. Service disruption during conversion
2. Security policy conflicts
3. Performance impact
4. Integration issues

## Mitigation Strategy
1. Detailed conversion plan with rollback procedures
2. Comprehensive testing in staging
3. Performance baseline and monitoring
4. Phased implementation approach

## Testing Requirements
1. Conversion Testing
   - Functionality verification
   - Multi-tenancy validation
   - Performance testing
   - Security testing

2. Integration Testing
   - Hub-spoke communication
   - Policy enforcement
   - Monitoring integration
   - Security controls

3. Validation Testing
   - End-to-end workflows
   - Failure scenarios
   - Recovery procedures
   - Performance metrics

## Documentation Requirements
1. Spoke architecture documentation
2. Conversion procedures
3. Configuration guides
4. Troubleshooting guides
5. Operational procedures

## Notes
- Maintain existing service levels during conversion
- Ensure backward compatibility where needed
- Document all configuration changes
- Create detailed rollback procedures
